# Project Requirements â€“ Public Recipe API

## Project Vision
Provide a free, open, reliable source of recipes through a RESTful API for developers and hobbyists.

## Project Goal
Build a backend API that allows public access to a collection of recipes, with the ability to search and filter them without authentication.

## Functional Requirements
- Retrieve all recipes
- Retrieve recipe by ID
- Search recipes by keyword (title, description)
- Filter recipes by:
  - Category (e.g., breakfast, dessert)
  - Main ingredient
  - Cook time (less than X minutes)
- Sort recipes by:
  - Creation date
- Paginate results

## Non-Functional Requirements
- No authentication required
- Static seed data used for recipes (no live third-party API)
- API versioning (e.g., /api/v1)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Postman collection for testing
- Environment profiles (dev/prod)
- CI for build and test

## Out of Scope
- User authentication
- Recipe submission
- Recipe rating
- Admin interface
